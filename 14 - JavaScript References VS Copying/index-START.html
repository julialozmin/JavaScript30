      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const dancers = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // one way
      const dancers2 = dancers.slice();

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const dancers3 = [].concat(dancers);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const dancers4 = [...dancers];

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",

      captain.number = 99;

      console.log(captain);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      const citizen2 = Object.assign({}, citizen, { number: 99, age: 12 });
      console.log(citizen2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      };

      //if we created a copy (wes2) and updated twitter or facebook on that copy, those properties would also be updated on the original object (wes).
      //To update second level attributes: function clone.deep

      //Tricky way to create a copy to update second level attributes: turn the original variable into a string with stringify and then back into an object with parse
